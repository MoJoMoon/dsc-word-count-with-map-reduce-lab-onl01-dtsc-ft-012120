    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in Spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will read a text corpus into the Spark environment, perform a word count, and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply the map(func) transformation to a given function on all elements of an RDD in different partitions \n",
    "- Apply a map transformation for all elements of an RDD \n",
    "- Compare the difference between a transformation and an action within RDDs \n",
    "- Use collect(), count(), and take() actions to trigger spark transformations \n",
    "- Use filter to select data that meets certain specifications within an RDD \n",
    "- Use Spark and the MapReduce framework to complete a full parallelized word count problem \n",
    "\n",
    "## MapReduce task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our problem looks like:\n",

    "* We have a huge text document\n",

    "\n",
    "* Sample applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Analyze web server logs to find popular URLs\n",
